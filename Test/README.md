The folder `Test` will contain all Unit testing for our code. When testing, you and me will create explicit file name of all module to be test.

    - By convention, the name of the folder must be snake_case, and must help the other collaborator to understand what module was tested and if it requires correction, or work properly.

    - i.e :[class or file name to test]-[method or function name to test]-[success or correction].php

    - example: Customer_getBookHouse_Success.php, Login_getPhoneNumber_incorrect.php
