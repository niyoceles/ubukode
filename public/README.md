The folder `public` should contain all procedural logics (Non-oriented-Object), it should contains SQL queries, and can call classes created inside `class` folder.

This will mainly be the area of work for Celestin, as you write code in procedural. 

But If you see that a code here could be translated to oriented object to avoid repeating same code, you can propose to put it inside the `class` folder, it means that we should convert it to OOP.
